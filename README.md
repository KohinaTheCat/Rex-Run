# <div align="center">T-Rex 🦖 </div>

## Motivation
We are all familiar with Google dinosaur game, so we thought it would be fun to recreate this game in 3D.

## What it does
Our game is basically a combination of Google's dinosaur game and an endless 3D runner. We set the scene in a city and the obstacles are cars on the road. We have a T-Rex as player and it need to avoid the cars and buildings. The T-Rex inspiration comes from the famous Jurrasic Park movies.

This project represents a gamers impression of a T-Rex of an endless runner in New York City **(under a budget)**. 

## Challenges we ran into
In order to build this project we had to learn C# in order to design games in Unity. Being beginners in the game design field, we had to learn designing game physics, using and modifying pre-existing assets for our use. We also learned how to create game objects through Blender and assign them player roles in Unity. In the end we were successfully able to combine various components into a consistent game with a vibrant Graphical User Interface.

## :trophy: Accomplishments that we're Proud of
- We broke the project structure down and built it component by component
- Our team communication we consistent and pointed towards improving our project every step of the way.
- We leveraged our inexperience in developing games to understand and use fundamentals of design with respect to a gaming engine.

## What we Learned
- Designing a game is easy, designing a game with a good physics design is not. 
- Learning game design enabled to open new avenues of creativity and master good programming practices.
- Game design is different from general software development (backend and frontend).
- Unity is a really good tool to get started with game design.
- Blenders Python scripting add-on should be leveraged

- Create different scenes other than city.
- Randomly generate cars
- Train an AI that can play the game itself
- Make the T-Rex run instead

### Ultimate Goal
- T-Rex Free Roam World.
