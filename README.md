## Motivation
We are all familiar with Google dinosaur game, so we thought it would be fun to recreate this game in 3D.

## What it does
Our game is a combination of Google's dinosaur game and an endless 3D runner. The dinosaur is set in the city, and the objective is to get as far as you can in the game while avoiding the cars on the road. The dinosaur is modeled off the infamous inflatable T-Rex costume that is often seen attempting to perform human stunts in a city environment.

## How to play
Press Space to make the dinosaur jump and press left/right to move left/right. 

## Challenges we ran into
In order to build this project, we had to learn C# in order to use Unity. As beginners in the game design field, we learned about game physics as well as using and modifying pre-existing assets. We also learned how to create game objects through Blender and use them in Unity. In the end, we were able to successfully combine various components into a complete game.

## :trophy: Accomplishments that we're Proud of
- We learned Unity and Blender in a little more than a week 
- We finished a complete game with start and end menus, scoring, and levels
- Our team communication was consistent and meetings were productive

## What We Learned
- Designing a game is easy; designing a game with good physics is not
- Game design is different from software development and leverages multiple areas of art: drawing, music, design, storytelling
- Unity is a really good tool to get started with game design

## Technologies Used :rocket:
<b>Built with</b>
- **Language:** `C#` 
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
