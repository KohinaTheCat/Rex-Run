## What it does

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
In order to build this project we had to learn C# in order to design games in Unity. Being beginners in the game design field, we had to learn designing game physics, using and modifying pre-existing assets for our use. We also learned how to create game objects through Blender and assign them player roles in Unity. In the end we were successfully able to combine various components into a consistent game with a vibrant Graphical User Interface.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We broke the project structure down and built it component by component
- Our team communication we consistent and pointed towards improving our project every step of the way.
- We leveratged our inexperience in developing games to understand and use fundamentals of design with respect to a gaming engine.
